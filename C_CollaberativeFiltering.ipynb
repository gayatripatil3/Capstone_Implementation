I tell wee stories. And some of them don\\'t even have punchlines. But you\\'ll get used to it as the night goes on, and on, and on, and on and on...\\'In December 2018, after fifty years of belly-laughs, energy and outrage, Billy Connolly announced his retirement from live stand-up comedy. It had been an extraordinary career.When he first started out in the late sixties, Billy played the banjo in the folk clubs of Scotland. Between songs, he would improvise a bit, telling anecdotes from the Clyde shipyard where he\\'d worked. In the process, he made all kinds of discoveries about what audiences found funny, from his own brilliant mimes to the power of speaking irreverently about politics or explicitly about sex. He began to understand the craft of great storytelling. Soon the songs became shorter and the monologues longer, and Billy quickly became recognised as one of the most exciting comedians of his generation.Billy\\'s routines always felt spontaneous. He never wrote scripts, always creating his comedy freshly on stage in the presence of a live audience. A brilliant comic story might be subsequently discarded, adapted or embellished. A quick observation or short anecdote one night, could become a twenty-minute segment by the next night of a tour.Billy always brought a beautiful sense of the absurd to his shows as he riffed on his family, hecklers, swimming in the North Sea or naked bungee jumping. But his comedy can be laced with anger too. He hates pretentiousness and calls out hypocrisy wherever he sees it. His insights about the human condition have shocked many people, while his unique talent and startling appearance on stage gave him license to say anything he damn well pleased about sex, politics or religion. Billy got away with it because he has always had the popular touch. His comedy spans generations and different social tribes in a way that few others have ever managed.Tall Tales and Wee Stories brings together the very best of Billy\\'s storytelling for the first time and includes his most famous routines including, The Last Supper, Jojoba Shampoo, Incontinence Pants and Shouting at Wildebeest. With an introduction and original illustrations by Billy throughout, it is an inspirational, energetic and riotously funny read, and a fitting celebration of our greatest ever comedian.\",Hachette UK,336,none,9.78E+12,English,\"Oct 17, 2019\"\\r\\n31,After Anna,Alex Lake,4.1,\"1,633\",20.51,SAR,\"No.1 EBOOK BESTSELLER.

William Shakespeare (1564 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 1616) was an English poet and playwright, widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world\\'s pre-eminent dramatist. He is often called England\\'s national poet and the \"\"Bard of Avon\"\". His extant works, including some collaborations, consist of about 38 plays, 154 sonnets, two long narrative poems, and a few other verses, the authorship of some of which is uncertain.\",e-artnow,1424,none,9.79E+12,English,\"Feb 27, 2014\"\\r\\n39,The Daylight War: Book Three of The Demon Cycle,Peter V.

Brett surged to the front rank of contemporary fantasy, standing alongside giants in the field such as George R. R. Martin, Robert Jordan, and Terry Brooks. The Daylight War, the eagerly anticipated third volume in Brett\\xe2\\x80\\x99s internationally bestselling Demon Cycle, continues the epic tale of humanity\\xe2\\x80\\x99s last stand against an army of demons that rise each night to prey on mankind.\\n\\n On the night of the new moon, the demons rise in force, seeking the deaths of two men, both of whom have the potential to become the fabled Deliverer, the man prophesied to reunite the scattered remnants of humanity in a final push to destroy the demon corelings once and for all.\\n\\n Arlen Bales was once an ordinary man, but now he has become something more\\xe2\\x80\\x94the Warded Man, tattooed with eldritch wards so powerful they make him a match for any demon. Arlen denies he is the Deliverer at every turn, but the more he tries to be one with the common folk, the more fervently they believe. Many would follow him, but Arlen\\xe2\\x80\\x99s path threatens to lead to a dark place he alone can travel to, and from which there may be no returning.\\n\\n The only one with hope of keeping Arlen in the world of men, or joining him in his descent into the world of demons, is Renna Tanner, a fierce young woman in danger of losing herself to the power of demon magic.\\n\\n Ahmann Jardir has forged the warlike desert tribes of Krasia into a demon-killing army and proclaimed himself Shar\\xe2\\x80\\x99Dama Ka, the Deliverer. He carries ancient weapons\\xe2\\x80\\x94a spear and a crown\\xe2\\x80\\x94that give credence to his claim, and already vast swaths of the green lands bow to his control.\\n\\n But Jardir did not come to power on his own. His rise was engineered by his First Wife, Inevera, a cunning and powerful priestess whose formidable demon bone magic gives her the ability to glimpse the future. Inevera\\xe2\\x80\\x99s motives and past are shrouded in mystery, and even Jardir does not entirely trust her.\\n\\n Once Arlen and Jardir were as close as brothers. Now they are the bitterest of rivals. As humanity\\xe2\\x80\\x99s enemies rise, the only two men capable of defeating them are divided against each other by the most deadly demons of all\\xe2\\x80\\x94those lurking in the human heart.\\n\\nLook for Peter V.

He was accused of killing Keith Russo, a lawyer in a small Florida town. But there were no reliable witnesses and little motive. Just the fact that Russo had botched Quincy\\'s divorce case, that Quincy was black in a largely all-white town and that a blood-splattered torch was found in the boot of Quincy\\'s car. A torch he swore was planted. A torch that was conveniently destroyed in a fire just before his trial. The lack of evidence made no difference to judge or jury. In the eyes of the law Quincy was guilty and, no matter how often he protested his innocence, his punishment was life in prison. Finally, after 22 years, comes Quincy\\'s one and only chance of freedom. An innocence lawyer and minister, Cullen Post, takes on his case. Post has exonerated eight men in the last ten years. He intends to make Quincy the next. But there were powerful and ruthless people behind Russo\\'s murder. They prefer that an innocent man dies in jail rather than one of them. There\\'s one way to guarantee that. They killed one lawyer 22 years ago, and they\\'ll kill another without a second thought.\\n\\nPraise for John Grisham\\'s THE GUARDIANS:...Grisham at his passionate best, conveying every ounce of his anger at the corruption behind the law. It is his finest book for some time. Do not miss it - Daily MailA canny and engrossing blend of two types of Grisham novel: enough of the familiar formula of a single lawsuit in a single town, mixed with a more picaresque and multistranded approach that has the significant advantage of taking in a wider swathe of America - The Sunday TimesDelivered with all his signature easy, flowing style. A past master at the art of deft characterisation and the skilful delivery of hair-raising crescendos, Grisham makes this a deceptively easy read. But The Guardians is much more than a simple legal divertissement... Grisham aims a spotlight at the all-too-prevalent venality of the American \\'win at all costs\\' prosecutorial attitude... much of his inspiration is based on tragic fact - Irish IndependentThe master of the legal thriller turns to one of his real-life passions - freeing those wrongly convicted. Inspired by true stories, the skilful plot follows an \"\"innocence lawyer\"\", who goes up against dangerous foes as he dedicates himself to freeing a man behind bars for the murder of a lawyer - Sunday MirrorThis is typical Grisham: speedy, gripping, very good at conveying the complexities of the law in a digestible way - Sunday ExpressSpeedy and gripping - Daily MirrorNo one with any interest in justice could resist this story, which Grisham has structured with all his familiar skill.

But what about the company that is not born with great DNA? How can good companies, mediocre companies, even bad companies achieve enduring greatness? The Study \\nFor years, this question preyed on the mind of Jim Collins. Are there companies that defy gravity and convert long-term mediocrity or worse into long-term superiority? And if so, what are the universal distinguishing characteristics that cause a company to go from good to great? The Standards \\nUsing tough benchmarks, Collins and his research team identified a set of elite companies that made the leap to great results and sustained those results for at least fifteen years. How great? After the leap, the good-to-great companies generated cumulative stock returns that beat the general stock market by an average of seven times in fifteen years, better than twice the results delivered by a composite index of the world\\'s greatest companies, including Coca-Cola, Intel, General Electric, and Merck.The Comparisons \\nThe research team contrasted the good-to-great companies with a carefully selected set of comparison companies that failed to make the leap from good to great. What was different? Why did one set of companies become truly great performers while the other set remained only good? Over five years, the team analyzed the histories of all twenty-eight companies in the study. After sifting through mountains of data and thousands of pages of interviews, Collins and his crew discovered the key determinants of greatness -- why some companies make the leap and others don\\'t. The Findings\\n The findings of the Good to Great study will surprise many readers and shed light on virtually every area of management strategy and practice. The findings include:Level 5 Leaders: The research team was shocked to discover the type of leadership required to achieve greatness. The Hedgehog Concept (Simplicity within the Three Circles): To go from good to great requires transcending the curse of competence. A Culture of Discipline: When you combine a culture of discipline with an ethic of entrepreneurship, you get the magical alchemy of great results. Technology Accelerators: Good-to-great companies think differently about the role of technology. The Flywheel and the Doom Loop: Those who launch radical change programs and wrenching restructurings will almost certainly fail to make the leap.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSome of the key concepts discerned in the study,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d comments Jim Collins, \"\"fly in the face of our modern business culture and will, quite frankly, upset some people.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Perhaps, but who can afford to ignore these findings?\",Harper Collins,320,\"Business &amp, Economics , Management\",9.78E+12,English,\"Jul 19, 2011\"\\r\\n77,How to Understand Business Finance: Edition 2,Bob Cinnamon,3.5,4,46.85,SAR,\"The modern marketplace is increasingly unpredictable and there is an ever-greater need for non-financial managers to understand the financial and management accounting process.How to Understand Business Finance is part of the bestselling Creating Success series published in association with the Sunday Times, which has been translated into 25 languages with over 500, 000 copies sold.

The time has come for her to learn about who she is, who her mother is, and to train and develop her special powers. Her father, Duncan, must lead his men south, to the great water city of Esephus, to attempt to free his fellow countrymen from the iron grip of Pandesia. Alec escapes with Marco from The Flames to find himself on the run through the Wood of Thorns, chased by exotic beasts. Merk, despite his better judgment, turns back to help the girl, and finds himself, for the first time in his life, entangled in a stranger\\xe2\\x80\\x99s affairs. Vesuvius spurs his giant as he leads the Trolls on their mission underground, attempting to bypass The Flames, while the dragon, Theos, has his own special mission on Escalon. In THE WEIGHT OF HONOR, Kyra finally meets her cryptic uncle, and is shocked to discover he is not the man she expected. She embarks on a period of training which will test her stamina and her frustration, as she soon encounters the limits of her power. Duncan must descend the peaks of Kos with his new army and, vastly outnumbered, launch a risky invasion on the capital. If he wins, waiting behind its ancient walls, he knows, will be the old king and his nest of nobles and aristocrats, all with their own agendas, all of them as quick to betray as they are to embrace. Alec, in Ur, must tap his unique skills in the forge to aid the resistance if they have any chance of defending against the looming Pandesian invasion. Merk finally enters the tower of Ur, and is stunned by what he discovers. Vesuvius leads his Troll nation across a vulnerable Escalon, devastating the land, while Theos, enraged at what becomes of his son, is on a rampage himself, and will not stop until all of Escalon is aflame. With its strong atmosphere and complex characters, KINGS AND SORCERERS is a sweeping saga of knights and warriors, of kings and lords, of honor and valor, of magic, destiny, monsters and dragons.

I tell wee stories. And some of them don\\'t even have punchlines. But you\\'ll get used to it as the night goes on, and on, and on, and on and on...\\'In December 2018, after fifty years of belly-laughs, energy and outrage, Billy Connolly announced his retirement from live stand-up comedy. It had been an extraordinary career.When he first started out in the late sixties, Billy played the banjo in the folk clubs of Scotland. Between songs, he would improvise a bit, telling anecdotes from the Clyde shipyard where he\\'d worked. In the process, he made all kinds of discoveries about what audiences found funny, from his own brilliant mimes to the power of speaking irreverently about politics or explicitly about sex. He began to understand the craft of great storytelling. Soon the songs became shorter and the monologues longer, and Billy quickly became recognised as one of the most exciting comedians of his generation.Billy\\'s routines always felt spontaneous. He never wrote scripts, always creating his comedy freshly on stage in the presence of a live audience. A brilliant comic story might be subsequently discarded, adapted or embellished. A quick observation or short anecdote one night, could become a twenty-minute segment by the next night of a tour.Billy always brought a beautiful sense of the absurd to his shows as he riffed on his family, hecklers, swimming in the North Sea or naked bungee jumping. But his comedy can be laced with anger too. He hates pretentiousness and calls out hypocrisy wherever he sees it. His insights about the human condition have shocked many people, while his unique talent and startling appearance on stage gave him license to say anything he damn well pleased about sex, politics or religion. Billy got away with it because he has always had the popular touch. His comedy spans generations and different social tribes in a way that few others have ever managed.Tall Tales and Wee Stories brings together the very best of Billy\\'s storytelling for the first time and includes his most famous routines including, The Last Supper, Jojoba Shampoo, Incontinence Pants and Shouting at Wildebeest. With an introduction and original illustrations by Billy throughout, it is an inspirational, energetic and riotously funny read, and a fitting celebration of our greatest ever comedian.\",Hachette UK,336,\"Humor , General\",9.78E+12,English,\"Oct 17, 2019\"\\r\\n123,\"Eat That Frog!: 21 Great Ways to Stop Procrastinating and Get More Done in Less Time, Edition 3\",Brian Tracy,4.7,46,62.82,SAR,\"It\\'s time to stop procrastinating and get more of the important things done!

The time has come for her to learn about who she is, who her mother is, and to train and develop her special powers. Her father, Duncan, must lead his men south, to the great water city of Esephus, to attempt to free his fellow countrymen from the iron grip of Pandesia. Alec escapes with Marco from The Flames to find himself on the run through the Wood of Thorns, chased by exotic beasts.

In THE WEIGHT OF HONOR, Kyra finally meets her cryptic uncle, and is shocked to discover he is not the man she expected. She embarks on a period of training which will test her stamina and her frustration, as she soon encounters the limits of her power. Duncan must descend the peaks of Kos with his new army and, vastly outnumbered, launch a risky invasion on the capital. If he wins, waiting behind its ancient walls, he knows, will be the old king and his nest of nobles and aristocrats, all with their own agendas, all of them as quick to betray as they are to embrace. Alec, in Ur, must tap his unique skills in the forge to aid the resistance if they have any chance of defending against the looming Pandesian invasion. Merk finally enters the tower of Ur, and is stunned by what he discovers. Vesuvius leads his Troll nation across a vulnerable Escalon, devastating the land, while Theos, enraged at what becomes of his son, is on a rampage himself, and will not stop until all of Escalon is aflame.

And how do you even know when you feel it?In Happy Derren Brown explores changing concepts of happiness - from the surprisingly modern wisdom of the Stoics and Epicureans in classical times right up until today, when the self-help industry has attempted to claim happiness as its own.

I almost always failed them.I tried to make changes last. They didn\\'t.Like most people who try to change and fail, I assumed that I was the problem.\\n\\nThen one afternoon--after another failed attempt to get motivated to exercise--I (accidentally) started my first mini habit. I initially committed to do one push-up, and it turned into a full workout. I was shocked. This \"\"stupid idea\"\" wasn\\'t supposed to work. I was shocked again when my success with this strategy continued for months (and to this day).\\n\\nI had to consider that maybe I wasn\\'t the problem in those 10 years of mediocre results. Maybe it was my prior strategies that were ineffective, despite being oft-repeated as \"\"the way to change\"\" in countless books and blogs.\\n\\nMy suspicions were correct.\\n\\nIs There A Scientific Explanation For This?\\nAs I sought understanding, I found a plethora of scientific studies that had answers, with nobody to interpret them correctly. Based on the science--which you\\'ll find peppered throughout Mini Habits--we\\'ve been doing it all wrong.\\n\\nYou can succeed without the guilt, intimidation, and repeated failure associated with such strategies as \"\"getting motivated,\"\" New Year\\'s Resolutions, or even \"\"just doing it.\"\" In fact, you need to stop using those strategies if they aren\\'t giving you great results.\\n\\nMost popular strategies don\\'t work well because they require you to fight against your subconscious brain (a fight not easily won). It\\'s only when you start playing by your brain\\'s rules and taking your human limitations seriously--as mini habits show you how to do--that you can achieve lasting change.\\n\\nWhat\\'s A Mini Habit?\\nA mini habit is a very small positive behavior that you force yourself to do every day; its \"\"too small to fail\"\" nature makes it weightless, deceptively powerful, and a superior habit-building strategy. You will have no choice but to believe in yourself when you\\'re always moving forward.\\n\\nThe barrier to the first step is so low that even depressed or \"\"stuck\"\" people can find early success and begin to reverse their lives right away. And if you think one push-up a day is too small to matter, I\\'ve got one heck of a story for you!\\n\\nAim For The First Step\\nThey say when you aim for the moon, you\\'ll land among the stars. Well, that doesn\\'t make sense, as the moon is closer than the stars. I digress.\\xc2\\xa0\\n\\nThe message is that you should aim very high and even if you fall short, you\\'ll still get somewhere. I\\'ve found the opposite to be true in regards to productivity and healthy behaviors. When you aim for the moon, you won\\'t do anything because it\\'s too far away. But when you aim for the step in front of you, you might keep going and reach the moon.\\n\\nI\\'ve used the Mini Habits strategy to get into the best shape of my life, read 10x more books, and write 4x as many words. It started from requiring one push-up from myself every day. How ridiculous is that? Not so ridiculous when you consider the science of the brain, habits, and willpower.\\n\\nThe Mini Habits system works because it\\'s how our brains are designed to change.\\n\\nNote:\\xc2\\xa0This book isn\\'t for eliminating bad habits (some principles could be useful for breaking habits). Mini Habits is a strategy to create permanent healthy habits in: exercise, writing, reading, thinking positively, meditating, drinking water, eating healthy foods, etc.\\n\\nLasting change won\\'t happen until you take that first step into a strategy that works. Give Mini Habits a try.

I almost always failed them.I tried to make changes last. They didn\\'t.Like most people who try to change and fail, I assumed that I was the problem.\\n\\nThen one afternoon--after another failed attempt to get motivated to exercise--I (accidentally) started my first mini habit. I initially committed to do one push-up, and it turned into a full workout. I was shocked. This \"\"stupid idea\"\" wasn\\'t supposed to work. I was shocked again when my success with this strategy continued for months (and to this day).\\n\\nI had to consider that maybe I wasn\\'t the problem in those 10 years of mediocre results. Maybe it was my prior strategies that were ineffective, despite being oft-repeated as \"\"the way to change\"\" in countless books and blogs.\\n\\nMy suspicions were correct.\\n\\nIs There A Scientific Explanation For This?\\nAs I sought understanding, I found a plethora of scientific studies that had answers, with nobody to interpret them correctly. Based on the science--which you\\'ll find peppered throughout Mini Habits--we\\'ve been doing it all wrong.\\n\\nYou can succeed without the guilt, intimidation, and repeated failure associated with such strategies as \"\"getting motivated,\"\" New Year\\'s Resolutions, or even \"\"just doing it.\"\" In fact, you need to stop using those strategies if they aren\\'t giving you great results.\\n\\nMost popular strategies don\\'t work well because they require you to fight against your subconscious brain (a fight not easily won). It\\'s only when you start playing by your brain\\'s rules and taking your human limitations seriously--as mini habits show you how to do--that you can achieve lasting change.\\n\\nWhat\\'s A Mini Habit?\\nA mini habit is a very small positive behavior that you force yourself to do every day; its \"\"too small to fail\"\" nature makes it weightless, deceptively powerful, and a superior habit-building strategy. You will have no choice but to believe in yourself when you\\'re always moving forward.\\n\\nThe barrier to the first step is so low that even depressed or \"\"stuck\"\" people can find early success and begin to reverse their lives right away. And if you think one push-up a day is too small to matter, I\\'ve got one heck of a story for you!\\n\\nAim For The First Step\\nThey say when you aim for the moon, you\\'ll land among the stars. Well, that doesn\\'t make sense, as the moon is closer than the stars. I digress.\\xc2\\xa0\\n\\nThe message is that you should aim very high and even if you fall short, you\\'ll still get somewhere. I\\'ve found the opposite to be true in regards to productivity and healthy behaviors. When you aim for the moon, you won\\'t do anything because it\\'s too far away. But when you aim for the step in front of you, you might keep going and reach the moon.\\n\\nI\\'ve used the Mini Habits strategy to get into the best shape of my life, read 10x more books, and write 4x as many words. It started from requiring one push-up from myself every day. How ridiculous is that? Not so ridiculous when you consider the science of the brain, habits, and willpower.\\n\\nThe Mini Habits system works because it\\'s how our brains are designed to change.\\n\\nNote:\\xc2\\xa0This book isn\\'t for eliminating bad habits (some principles could be useful for breaking habits). Mini Habits is a strategy to create permanent healthy habits in: exercise, writing, reading, thinking positively, meditating, drinking water, eating healthy foods, etc.\\n\\nLasting change won\\'t happen until you take that first step into a strategy that works.

While business administration professionals tend to consider information technology as a subordinate aspect in business process management for experts to handle, by contrast computer science professionals often consider business goals and organizational regulations as terms that do not deserve much thought but require the appropriate level of abstraction.Matthias Weske argues that all communities involved need to have a common understanding of the different aspects of business process management. To this end, he details the complete business process lifecycle from the modeling phase to process enactment and improvement, taking into account all different stakeholders involved. After starting with a presentation of general foundations and abstraction models, he explains concepts like process orchestrations and choreographies, as well as process properties and data dependencies. Finally, he presents both traditional and advanced business process management architectures, covering, for example, workflow management systems, service-oriented architectures, and data-driven approaches. In addition, he shows how standards like WfMC, SOAP, WSDL, and BPEL fit into the picture.This textbook is ideally suited for classes on business process management, information systems architecture, and workflow management.

A bundle of\\xc2\\xa0 books 2 and 3 in Morgan Rice\\xe2\\x80\\x99s #1 Bestselling fantasy series KINGS AND SORCERERS (RISE OF THE VALIANT and THE WEIGHT OF HONOR). Here are two bestselling novels, all in one convenient file. In RISE OF THE VALIANT, Kyra is sent on an urgent quest: to cross Escalon and seek out her uncle in the mysterious Tower of Ur. The time has come for her to learn about who she is, who her mother is, and to train and develop her special powers. Her father, Duncan, must lead his men south, to the great water city of Esephus, to attempt to free his fellow countrymen from the iron grip of Pandesia. Alec escapes with Marco from The Flames to find himself on the run through the Wood of Thorns, chased by exotic beasts. Merk, despite his better judgment, turns back to help the girl, and finds himself, for the first time in his life, entangled in a stranger\\xe2\\x80\\x99s affairs. Vesuvius spurs his giant as he leads the Trolls on their mission underground, attempting to bypass The Flames, while the dragon, Theos, has his own special mission on Escalon. In THE WEIGHT OF HONOR, Kyra finally meets her cryptic uncle, and is shocked to discover he is not the man she expected. She embarks on a period of training which will test her stamina and her frustration, as she soon encounters the limits of her power. Duncan must descend the peaks of Kos with his new army and, vastly outnumbered, launch a risky invasion on the capital. If he wins, waiting behind its ancient walls, he knows, will be the old king and his nest of nobles and aristocrats, all with their own agendas, all of them as quick to betray as they are to embrace. Alec, in Ur, must tap his unique skills in the forge to aid the resistance if they have any chance of defending against the looming Pandesian invasion. Merk finally enters the tower of Ur, and is stunned by what he discovers. Vesuvius leads his Troll nation across a vulnerable Escalon, devastating the land, while Theos, enraged at what becomes of his son, is on a rampage himself, and will not stop until all of Escalon is aflame. With its strong atmosphere and complex characters, KINGS AND SORCERERS is a sweeping saga of knights and warriors, of kings and lords, of honor and valor, of magic, destiny, monsters and dragons. It is fantasy at its finest, inviting us into a world that will live with us forever, one that appeals to all ages and genders.\",Morgan Rice,500,none,9.78E+12,English,\"Feb 25, 2016\"\\r\\n399,\"Business Process Management: Concepts, Languages, Architectures, Edition 2\",Mathias Weske,2.5,2,265.39,SAR,\"Business process management is usually treated from two different perspectives: business administration and computer science. While business administration professionals tend to consider information technology as a subordinate aspect in business process management for experts to handle, by contrast computer science professionals often consider business goals and organizational regulations as terms that do not deserve much thought but require the appropriate level of abstraction.Matthias Weske argues that all communities involved need to have a common understanding of the different aspects of business process management. To this end, he details the complete business process lifecycle from the modeling phase to process enactment and improvement, taking into account all different stakeholders involved. After starting with a presentation of general foundations and abstraction models, he explains concepts like process orchestrations and choreographies, as well as process properties and data dependencies. Finally, he presents both traditional and advanced business process management architectures, covering, for example, workflow management systems, service-oriented architectures, and data-driven approaches. In addition, he shows how standards like WfMC, SOAP, WSDL, and BPEL fit into the picture.This textbook is ideally suited for classes on business process management, information systems architecture, and workflow management. This 2nd edition contains major updates on BPMN Version 2 process orchestration and process choreographies, and the chapter on BPM methodologies has been completely rewritten.

I tell wee stories. And some of them don\\'t even have punchlines. But you\\'ll get used to it as the night goes on, and on, and on, and on and on...\\'In December 2018, after fifty years of belly-laughs, energy and outrage, Billy Connolly announced his retirement from live stand-up comedy. It had been an extraordinary career.When he first started out in the late sixties, Billy played the banjo in the folk clubs of Scotland. Between songs, he would improvise a bit, telling anecdotes from the Clyde shipyard where he\\'d worked. In the process, he made all kinds of discoveries about what audiences found funny, from his own brilliant mimes to the power of speaking irreverently about politics or explicitly about sex. He began to understand the craft of great storytelling. Soon the songs became shorter and the monologues longer, and Billy quickly became recognised as one of the most exciting comedians of his generation.Billy\\'s routines always felt spontaneous. He never wrote scripts, always creating his comedy freshly on stage in the presence of a live audience. A brilliant comic story might be subsequently discarded, adapted or embellished. A quick observation or short anecdote one night, could become a twenty-minute segment by the next night of a tour.Billy always brought a beautiful sense of the absurd to his shows as he riffed on his family, hecklers, swimming in the North Sea or naked bungee jumping. But his comedy can be laced with anger too. He hates pretentiousness and calls out hypocrisy wherever he sees it. His insights about the human condition have shocked many people, while his unique talent and startling appearance on stage gave him license to say anything he damn well pleased about sex, politics or religion. Billy got away with it because he has always had the popular touch. His comedy spans generations and different social tribes in a way that few others have ever managed.Tall Tales and Wee Stories brings together the very best of Billy\\'s storytelling for the first time and includes his most famous routines including, The Last Supper, Jojoba Shampoo, Incontinence Pants and Shouting at Wildebeest. With an introduction and original illustrations by Billy throughout, it is an inspirational, energetic and riotously funny read, and a fitting celebration of our greatest ever comedian.\",Hachette UK,336,none,9.78E+12,English,\"Oct 17, 2019\"\\r\\n453,\"Mini Habits: Smaller Habits, Bigger Results\",Stephen Guise,4.6,66,23.59,SAR,\"Discover the Life-Changing Strategy of This Worldwide Bestseller in 17 Languages!\\nUPDATED: Includes the best habit tracking apps of 2017.Lasting Change For Early Quitters, Burnouts, The Unmotivated, And Everyone Else Too\\xc2\\xa0\\n\\nWhen I decided to start exercising consistently 10 years ago, this is what actually happened:\\xc2\\xa0I tried \"\"getting motivated.\"\" It worked sometimes.I tried setting audacious big goals. I almost always failed them.I tried to make changes last. They didn\\'t.Like most people who try to change and fail, I assumed that I was the problem.\\n\\nThen one afternoon--after another failed attempt to get motivated to exercise--I (accidentally) started my first mini habit. I initially committed to do one push-up, and it turned into a full workout. I was shocked. This \"\"stupid idea\"\" wasn\\'t supposed to work. I was shocked again when my success with this strategy continued for months (and to this day).\\n\\nI had to consider that maybe I wasn\\'t the problem in those 10 years of mediocre results. Maybe it was my prior strategies that were ineffective, despite being oft-repeated as \"\"the way to change\"\" in countless books and blogs.\\n\\nMy suspicions were correct.\\n\\nIs There A Scientific Explanation For This?\\nAs I sought understanding, I found a plethora of scientific studies that had answers, with nobody to interpret them correctly. Based on the science--which you\\'ll find peppered throughout Mini Habits--we\\'ve been doing it all wrong.\\n\\nYou can succeed without the guilt, intimidation, and repeated failure associated with such strategies as \"\"getting motivated,\"\" New Year\\'s Resolutions, or even \"\"just doing it.\"\" In fact, you need to stop using those strategies if they aren\\'t giving you great results.\\n\\nMost popular strategies don\\'t work well because they require you to fight against your subconscious brain (a fight not easily won). It\\'s only when you start playing by your brain\\'s rules and taking your human limitations seriously--as mini habits show you how to do--that you can achieve lasting change.\\n\\nWhat\\'s A Mini Habit?\\nA mini habit is a very small positive behavior that you force yourself to do every day; its \"\"too small to fail\"\" nature makes it weightless, deceptively powerful, and a superior habit-building strategy. You will have no choice but to believe in yourself when you\\'re always moving forward.\\n\\nThe barrier to the first step is so low that even depressed or \"\"stuck\"\" people can find early success and begin to reverse their lives right away. And if you think one push-up a day is too small to matter, I\\'ve got one heck of a story for you!\\n\\nAim For The First Step\\nThey say when you aim for the moon, you\\'ll land among the stars. Well, that doesn\\'t make sense, as the moon is closer than the stars. I digress.\\xc2\\xa0\\n\\nThe message is that you should aim very high and even if you fall short, you\\'ll still get somewhere. I\\'ve found the opposite to be true in regards to productivity and healthy behaviors. When you aim for the moon, you won\\'t do anything because it\\'s too far away. But when you aim for the step in front of you, you might keep going and reach the moon.\\n\\nI\\'ve used the Mini Habits strategy to get into the best shape of my life, read 10x more books, and write 4x as many words. It started from requiring one push-up from myself every day. How ridiculous is that? Not so ridiculous when you consider the science of the brain, habits, and willpower.\\n\\nThe Mini Habits system works because it\\'s how our brains are designed to change.\\n\\nNote:\\xc2\\xa0This book isn\\'t for eliminating bad habits (some principles could be useful for breaking habits).

Introduction to Psychoanalysis is a set of lectures given by Sigmund Freud 1915-17, which became the most popular and widely translated of his works. The 28 lectures offered an elementary stock-taking of his views of the unconscious, dreams, and the theory of neuroses at the time of writing, as well as offering some new technical material to the more advanced reader. In these three-part Introductory Lectures, by beginning with a discussion of Freudian slips in the first part, moving on to dreams in the second, and only tackling the neuroses in the third, Freud succeeded in presenting his ideas as firmly grounded in the common-sense world of everyday experience. Freud built his complete method of psycho-analysis around his dream theories. In the book Dream Psychology: Psychoanalysis for Beginners Freud explains the buried meanings inside dreams, particularly the drive and the connection between the unconscious and conscious, blocked sexual cravings, and the significance of dreams to our overall well-being. Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) was an Austrian neurologist and the father of psychoanalysis, a clinical method for treating psychopathology through dialogue between a patient and a psychoanalyst. In creating psychoanalysis, Freud developed therapeutic techniques such as the use of free association and discovered transference, establishing its central role in the analytic process.

He was accused of killing Keith Russo, a lawyer in a small Florida town. But there were no reliable witnesses and little motive. Just the fact that Russo had botched Quincy\\'s divorce case, that Quincy was black in a largely all-white town and that a blood-splattered torch was found in the boot of Quincy\\'s car. A torch he swore was planted. A torch that was conveniently destroyed in a fire just before his trial. The lack of evidence made no difference to judge or jury. In the eyes of the law Quincy was guilty and, no matter how often he protested his innocence, his punishment was life in prison. Finally, after 22 years, comes Quincy\\'s one and only chance of freedom. An innocence lawyer and minister, Cullen Post, takes on his case. Post has exonerated eight men in the last ten years. He intends to make Quincy the next. But there were powerful and ruthless people behind Russo\\'s murder. They prefer that an innocent man dies in jail rather than one of them.

Here are two bestselling novels, all in one convenient file. In RISE OF THE VALIANT, Kyra is sent on an urgent quest: to cross Escalon and seek out her uncle in the mysterious Tower of Ur. The time has come for her to learn about who she is, who her mother is, and to train and develop her special powers. Her father, Duncan, must lead his men south, to the great water city of Esephus, to attempt to free his fellow countrymen from the iron grip of Pandesia. Alec escapes with Marco from The Flames to find himself on the run through the Wood of Thorns, chased by exotic beasts. Merk, despite his better judgment, turns back to help the girl, and finds himself, for the first time in his life, entangled in a stranger\\xe2\\x80\\x99s affairs. Vesuvius spurs his giant as he leads the Trolls on their mission underground, attempting to bypass The Flames, while the dragon, Theos, has his own special mission on Escalon. In THE WEIGHT OF HONOR, Kyra finally meets her cryptic uncle, and is shocked to discover he is not the man she expected. She embarks on a period of training which will test her stamina and her frustration, as she soon encounters the limits of her power. Duncan must descend the peaks of Kos with his new army and, vastly outnumbered, launch a risky invasion on the capital. If he wins, waiting behind its ancient walls, he knows, will be the old king and his nest of nobles and aristocrats, all with their own agendas, all of them as quick to betray as they are to embrace. Alec, in Ur, must tap his unique skills in the forge to aid the resistance if they have any chance of defending against the looming Pandesian invasion.

While business administration professionals tend to consider information technology as a subordinate aspect in business process management for experts to handle, by contrast computer science professionals often consider business goals and organizational regulations as terms that do not deserve much thought but require the appropriate level of abstraction.Matthias Weske argues that all communities involved need to have a common understanding of the different aspects of business process management. To this end, he details the complete business process lifecycle from the modeling phase to process enactment and improvement, taking into account all different stakeholders involved. After starting with a presentation of general foundations and abstraction models, he explains concepts like process orchestrations and choreographies, as well as process properties and data dependencies. Finally, he presents both traditional and advanced business process management architectures, covering, for example, workflow management systems, service-oriented architectures, and data-driven approaches. In addition, he shows how standards like WfMC, SOAP, WSDL, and BPEL fit into the picture.This textbook is ideally suited for classes on business process management, information systems architecture, and workflow management.

While business administration professionals tend to consider information technology as a subordinate aspect in business process management for experts to handle, by contrast computer science professionals often consider business goals and organizational regulations as terms that do not deserve much thought but require the appropriate level of abstraction.Matthias Weske argues that all communities involved need to have a common understanding of the different aspects of business process management. To this end, he details the complete business process lifecycle from the modeling phase to process enactment and improvement, taking into account all different stakeholders involved. After starting with a presentation of general foundations and abstraction models, he explains concepts like process orchestrations and choreographies, as well as process properties and data dependencies. Finally, he presents both traditional and advanced business process management architectures, covering, for example, workflow management systems, service-oriented architectures, and data-driven approaches. In addition, he shows how standards like WfMC, SOAP, WSDL, and BPEL fit into the picture.This textbook is ideally suited for classes on business process management, information systems architecture, and workflow management.

You can know everything about marketing, sales, negotiations, stocks, real estate, and the world of finance, but if your money blueprint is not set for a high level of success, you will never have a lot of money\\xe2\\x80\\x94and if somehow you do, you will most likely lose it! The good news is that now you can actually reset your money blueprint to create natural and automatic success.Secrets of the Millionaire Mind is two books in one. Part I explains how your money blueprint works. Through Eker\\'s rare combination of street smarts, humor, and heart, you will learn how your childhood influences have shaped your financial destiny. You will also learn how to identify your own money blueprint and \"\"revise\"\" it to not only create success but, more important, to keep and continually grow it.In Part II you will be introduced to seventeen \"\"Wealth Files,\"\" which describe exactly how rich people think and act differently than most poor and middle-class people. Each Wealth File includes action steps for you to practice in the real world in order to dramatically increase your income and accumulate wealth.If you are not doing as well financially as you would like, you will have to change your money blueprint. Unfortunately your current money blueprint will tend to stay with you for the rest of your life, unless you identify and revise it, and that\\'s exactly what you will do with the help of this extraordinary book. According to T. Harv Eker, it\\'s simple. If you think like rich people think and do what rich people do, chances are you\\'ll get rich too!\",Harper Collins,224,\"Business &amp, Economics , Entrepreneurship\",9.78E+12,English,\"Oct 13, 2009\"\\r\\n573,Eeny Meeny: DI Helen Grace 1,M.

It had been an extraordinary career.When he first started out in the late sixties, Billy played the banjo in the folk clubs of Scotland. Between songs, he would improvise a bit, telling anecdotes from the Clyde shipyard where he\\'d worked. In the process, he made all kinds of discoveries about what audiences found funny, from his own brilliant mimes to the power of speaking irreverently about politics or explicitly about sex. He began to understand the craft of great storytelling. Soon the songs became shorter and the monologues longer, and Billy quickly became recognised as one of the most exciting comedians of his generation.Billy\\'s routines always felt spontaneous. He never wrote scripts, always creating his comedy freshly on stage in the presence of a live audience. A brilliant comic story might be subsequently discarded, adapted or embellished. A quick observation or short anecdote one night, could become a twenty-minute segment by the next night of a tour.Billy always brought a beautiful sense of the absurd to his shows as he riffed on his family, hecklers, swimming in the North Sea or naked bungee jumping. But his comedy can be laced with anger too. He hates pretentiousness and calls out hypocrisy wherever he sees it. His insights about the human condition have shocked many people, while his unique talent and startling appearance on stage gave him license to say anything he damn well pleased about sex, politics or religion. Billy got away with it because he has always had the popular touch. His comedy spans generations and different social tribes in a way that few others have ever managed.Tall Tales and Wee Stories brings together the very best of Billy\\'s storytelling for the first time and includes his most famous routines including, The Last Supper, Jojoba Shampoo, Incontinence Pants and Shouting at Wildebeest. With an introduction and original illustrations by Billy throughout, it is an inspirational, energetic and riotously funny read, and a fitting celebration of our greatest ever comedian.\",Hachette UK,336,\"Biography &amp, Autobiography , Entertainment &amp, Performing Arts\",9.78E+12,English,\"Oct 17, 2019\"\\r\\n587,Business Strategy (The Brian Tracy Success Library),Brian Tracy,,,38.33,SAR,\"How will you determine if your company has succeeded if you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t base its performance on a well-defined business strategy?

Charm, persuasion, the ability to create illusions: these are some of the many dazzling gifts of the Seducer, the compelling figure who is able to manipulate, mislead and give pleasure all at once. When raised to the level of art, seduction, an indirect and subtle form of power, has toppled empires, won elections and enslaved great minds.

But what about the company that is not born with great DNA? How can good companies, mediocre companies, even bad companies achieve enduring greatness? The Study \\nFor years, this question preyed on the mind of Jim Collins. Are there companies that defy gravity and convert long-term mediocrity or worse into long-term superiority? And if so, what are the universal distinguishing characteristics that cause a company to go from good to great? The Standards \\nUsing tough benchmarks, Collins and his research team identified a set of elite companies that made the leap to great results and sustained those results for at least fifteen years. How great? After the leap, the good-to-great companies generated cumulative stock returns that beat the general stock market by an average of seven times in fifteen years, better than twice the results delivered by a composite index of the world\\'s greatest companies, including Coca-Cola, Intel, General Electric, and Merck.The Comparisons \\nThe research team contrasted the good-to-great companies with a carefully selected set of comparison companies that failed to make the leap from good to great. What was different? Why did one set of companies become truly great performers while the other set remained only good? Over five years, the team analyzed the histories of all twenty-eight companies in the study. After sifting through mountains of data and thousands of pages of interviews, Collins and his crew discovered the key determinants of greatness -- why some companies make the leap and others don\\'t. The Findings\\n The findings of the Good to Great study will surprise many readers and shed light on virtually every area of management strategy and practice. The findings include:Level 5 Leaders: The research team was shocked to discover the type of leadership required to achieve greatness. The Hedgehog Concept (Simplicity within the Three Circles): To go from good to great requires transcending the curse of competence. A Culture of Discipline: When you combine a culture of discipline with an ethic of entrepreneurship, you get the magical alchemy of great results. Technology Accelerators: Good-to-great companies think differently about the role of technology. The Flywheel and the Doom Loop: Those who launch radical change programs and wrenching restructurings will almost certainly fail to make the leap.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSome of the key concepts discerned in the study,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d comments Jim Collins, \"\"fly in the face of our modern business culture and will, quite frankly, upset some people.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Perhaps, but who can afford to ignore these findings?\",Harper Collins,320,none,9.78E+12,English,\"Jul 19, 2011\"\\r\\n614,\"The Painted Man (The Demon Cycle, Book 1)\",Peter V.

Their rich, compelling narrative is filled with stories never told before from the people who knew Jobs best, including his family, former inner circle executives, and top people at Apple, Pixar and Disney, most notably Tim Cook, Jony Ive, Eddy Cue, Ed Catmull, John Lasseter, Robert Iger and many others. In addition, Schlender knew Jobs personally for 25 years and draws upon his many interviews with him, on and off the record, in writing the book. He and Tetzeli humanize the man and explain, rather than simply describe, his behavior.

It is said to be the definitive work on military strategies and tactics of its time, and is still read for its military insight which can be applied to business and managerial strategies as well.\",e-artnow,80,\"Body, Mind &amp, Spirit , General\",9.79E+12,English,\"Jun 2, 2012\"\\r\\n672,\"Mini Habits: Smaller Habits, Bigger Results\",Stephen Guise,4.6,66,23.59,SAR,\"Discover the Life-Changing Strategy of This Worldwide Bestseller in 17 Languages!\\nUPDATED: Includes the best habit tracking apps of 2017.Lasting Change For Early Quitters, Burnouts, The Unmotivated, And Everyone Else Too\\xc2\\xa0\\n\\nWhen I decided to start exercising consistently 10 years ago, this is what actually happened:\\xc2\\xa0I tried \"\"getting motivated.\"\" It worked sometimes.I tried setting audacious big goals. I almost always failed them.I tried to make changes last. They didn\\'t.Like most people who try to change and fail, I assumed that I was the problem.\\n\\nThen one afternoon--after another failed attempt to get motivated to exercise--I (accidentally) started my first mini habit. I initially committed to do one push-up, and it turned into a full workout. I was shocked. This \"\"stupid idea\"\" wasn\\'t supposed to work. I was shocked again when my success with this strategy continued for months (and to this day).\\n\\nI had to consider that maybe I wasn\\'t the problem in those 10 years of mediocre results. Maybe it was my prior strategies that were ineffective, despite being oft-repeated as \"\"the way to change\"\" in countless books and blogs.\\n\\nMy suspicions were correct.\\n\\nIs There A Scientific Explanation For This?\\nAs I sought understanding, I found a plethora of scientific studies that had answers, with nobody to interpret them correctly. Based on the science--which you\\'ll find peppered throughout Mini Habits--we\\'ve been doing it all wrong.\\n\\nYou can succeed without the guilt, intimidation, and repeated failure associated with such strategies as \"\"getting motivated,\"\" New Year\\'s Resolutions, or even \"\"just doing it.\"\" In fact, you need to stop using those strategies if they aren\\'t giving you great results.\\n\\nMost popular strategies don\\'t work well because they require you to fight against your subconscious brain (a fight not easily won). It\\'s only when you start playing by your brain\\'s rules and taking your human limitations seriously--as mini habits show you how to do--that you can achieve lasting change.\\n\\nWhat\\'s A Mini Habit?\\nA mini habit is a very small positive behavior that you force yourself to do every day; its \"\"too small to fail\"\" nature makes it weightless, deceptively powerful, and a superior habit-building strategy. You will have no choice but to believe in yourself when you\\'re always moving forward.\\n\\nThe barrier to the first step is so low that even depressed or \"\"stuck\"\" people can find early success and begin to reverse their lives right away. And if you think one push-up a day is too small to matter, I\\'ve got one heck of a story for you!\\n\\nAim For The First Step\\nThey say when you aim for the moon, you\\'ll land among the stars. Well, that doesn\\'t make sense, as the moon is closer than the stars. I digress.\\xc2\\xa0\\n\\nThe message is that you should aim very high and even if you fall short, you\\'ll still get somewhere. I\\'ve found the opposite to be true in regards to productivity and healthy behaviors. When you aim for the moon, you won\\'t do anything because it\\'s too far away. But when you aim for the step in front of you, you might keep going and reach the moon.\\n\\nI\\'ve used the Mini Habits strategy to get into the best shape of my life, read 10x more books, and write 4x as many words. It started from requiring one push-up from myself every day. How ridiculous is that? Not so ridiculous when you consider the science of the brain, habits, and willpower.\\n\\nThe Mini Habits system works because it\\'s how our brains are designed to change.\\n\\nNote:\\xc2\\xa0This book isn\\'t for eliminating bad habits (some principles could be useful for breaking habits). Mini Habits is a strategy to create permanent healthy habits in: exercise, writing, reading, thinking positively, meditating, drinking water, eating healthy foods, etc.\\n\\nLasting change won\\'t happen until you take that first step into a strategy that works. Give Mini Habits a try. You won\\'t look back.\",Selective Entertainment LLC,126,\"Self-Help , Motivational &amp, Inspirational\",9.78E+12,English,\"Dec 22, 2013\"\\r\\n673,Rogues,George R. R.

But what about the company that is not born with great DNA? How can good companies, mediocre companies, even bad companies achieve enduring greatness? The Study \\nFor years, this question preyed on the mind of Jim Collins. Are there companies that defy gravity and convert long-term mediocrity or worse into long-term superiority? And if so, what are the universal distinguishing characteristics that cause a company to go from good to great? The Standards \\nUsing tough benchmarks, Collins and his research team identified a set of elite companies that made the leap to great results and sustained those results for at least fifteen years. How great? After the leap, the good-to-great companies generated cumulative stock returns that beat the general stock market by an average of seven times in fifteen years, better than twice the results delivered by a composite index of the world\\'s greatest companies, including Coca-Cola, Intel, General Electric, and Merck.The Comparisons \\nThe research team contrasted the good-to-great companies with a carefully selected set of comparison companies that failed to make the leap from good to great. What was different? Why did one set of companies become truly great performers while the other set remained only good? Over five years, the team analyzed the histories of all twenty-eight companies in the study. After sifting through mountains of data and thousands of pages of interviews, Collins and his crew discovered the key determinants of greatness -- why some companies make the leap and others don\\'t. The Findings\\n The findings of the Good to Great study will surprise many readers and shed light on virtually every area of management strategy and practice. The findings include:Level 5 Leaders: The research team was shocked to discover the type of leadership required to achieve greatness. The Hedgehog Concept (Simplicity within the Three Circles): To go from good to great requires transcending the curse of competence. A Culture of Discipline: When you combine a culture of discipline with an ethic of entrepreneurship, you get the magical alchemy of great results. Technology Accelerators: Good-to-great companies think differently about the role of technology.

The answers will surprise you. Predictably Irrational is an intriguing, witty and utterly original look at why we all make illogical decisions. Why can a 50p aspirin do what a 5p aspirin can\\'t? If an item is \"\"free\"\" it must be a bargain, right? Why is everything relative, even when it shouldn\\'t be? How do our expectations influence our actual opinions and decisions? In this astounding book, behavioural economist Dan Ariely cuts to the heart of our strange behaviour, demonstrating how irrationality often supplants rational thought and that the reason for this is embedded in the very structure of our minds. Predicatably Irrational brilliantly blends everyday experiences with a series of illuminating and often surprising experiments, that will change your understanding of human behaviour. And, by recognising these patterns, Ariely shows that we can make better decisions in business, in matters of collective welfare, and in our everyday lives from drinking coffee to losing weight, buying a car to choosing a romantic partner.\",HarperCollins UK,304,\"Business &amp, Economics , Economics , General\",9.78E+12,English,\"Mar 6, 2009\"\\r\\n737,Injustice: Gods Among Us Year One - The Complete Collection: Issues 1-12,Tom Taylor,4.7,391,98.42,SAR,\"Inspired by the video game phenomenon, INJUSTICE: GODS AMONG US YEAR ONE-THE COMPLETE EDITION collects the initial year of the best-selling series in its entirety for the first time!

The time has come for her to learn about who she is, who her mother is, and to train and develop her special powers. Her father, Duncan, must lead his men south, to the great water city of Esephus, to attempt to free his fellow countrymen from the iron grip of Pandesia. Alec escapes with Marco from The Flames to find himself on the run through the Wood of Thorns, chased by exotic beasts.

Vesuvius spurs his giant as he leads the Trolls on their mission underground, attempting to bypass The Flames, while the dragon, Theos, has his own special mission on Escalon. In THE WEIGHT OF HONOR, Kyra finally meets her cryptic uncle, and is shocked to discover he is not the man she expected. She embarks on a period of training which will test her stamina and her frustration, as she soon encounters the limits of her power. Duncan must descend the peaks of Kos with his new army and, vastly outnumbered, launch a risky invasion on the capital. If he wins, waiting behind its ancient walls, he knows, will be the old king and his nest of nobles and aristocrats, all with their own agendas, all of them as quick to betray as they are to embrace. Alec, in Ur, must tap his unique skills in the forge to aid the resistance if they have any chance of defending against the looming Pandesian invasion. Merk finally enters the tower of Ur, and is stunned by what he discovers. Vesuvius leads his Troll nation across a vulnerable Escalon, devastating the land, while Theos, enraged at what becomes of his son, is on a rampage himself, and will not stop until all of Escalon is aflame. With its strong atmosphere and complex characters, KINGS AND SORCERERS is a sweeping saga of knights and warriors, of kings and lords, of honor and valor, of magic, destiny, monsters and dragons.

The Art of War By Sun Tzu translated and commented on by Lionel Giles, On War by Carl von Clausewitz, The Art of War by Niccol\\xc3\\xb2 Machiavelli, and The Art of War by Baron De Jomini. These four books will give you as complete a view on the art of war as you can attain. This is the most important book ever written about warfare and conflict. Lionel Giles\\' translation is the definitive edition and his commentary is indispensable. The Art of War can be used and adapted in every facet of your life. This book explains when and how to go to war, as well as when not to. Learn how to win any conflict whether it be on the battlefield or in the boardroom. Although Carl von Clausewitz participated in many military campaigns, he was primarily a military theorist interested in the examination of war. On War is the West\\'s premier work on the philosophy of war. Other soldiers before him had written treatises on various military subjects, but none undertook a great philosophical examination of war on the scale of Clausewitz\\'s. On War is considered to be the first modern book of military strategy. This is due mainly to Clausewitz\\' integration of political, social, and economic issues as some of the most important factors in deciding the outcomes of a war. It is one of the most important treatises on strategy ever written, and continues to be required reading at many military academies. Niccolo Machiavelli considered this book his greatest achievement. Here you will learn how to recruit, train, motivate, and discipline an army. You will learn the difference between strategy and tactics. Machiavelli does a masterful job of breaking down and analyzing historic battles. This book of military knowledge belongs alongside Sun-Tzu and Clausewitz on every book shelf. Antoine-Henri Jomini was the most celebrated writer on the Napoleonic art of war. Jomini was present at most of the most important battles of the Napoleonic Wars. His writing, therefore, is the most authoritative on the subject. \"\"The art of war, as generally considered, consists of five purely military branches,-viz.: Strategy, Grand Tactics, Logistics, Engineering, and Tactics. A sixth and essential branch, hitherto unrecognized, might be termed Diplomacy in its relation to War. Although this branch is more naturally and intimately connected with the profession of a statesman than with that of a soldier, it cannot be denied that, if it be useless to a subordinate general, it is indispensable to every general commanding an army.\"\" -Antoine-Henri Jomini\",Simon and Schuster,667,\"Political Science , Political Ideologies , General\",9.78E+12,English,\"Apr 29, 2013\"\\r\\n747,Ready Player One,Ernest Cline,4.6,\"17,719\",39.34,SAR,\"Nominated as one of America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s best-loved novels by PBS\\xe2\\x80\\x99s The Great American Read\\n\\nThe worldwide bestseller\\xe2\\x80\\x94now a major motion picture directed by Steven Spielberg.\\n\\nIn the year 2045, reality is an ugly place.

He was accused of killing Keith Russo, a lawyer in a small Florida town. But there were no reliable witnesses and little motive. Just the fact that Russo had botched Quincy\\'s divorce case, that Quincy was black in a largely all-white town and that a blood-splattered torch was found in the boot of Quincy\\'s car. A torch he swore was planted. A torch that was conveniently destroyed in a fire just before his trial. The lack of evidence made no difference to judge or jury. In the eyes of the law Quincy was guilty and, no matter how often he protested his innocence, his punishment was life in prison. Finally, after 22 years, comes Quincy\\'s one and only chance of freedom. An innocence lawyer and minister, Cullen Post, takes on his case. Post has exonerated eight men in the last ten years. He intends to make Quincy the next. But there were powerful and ruthless people behind Russo\\'s murder. They prefer that an innocent man dies in jail rather than one of them. There\\'s one way to guarantee that.

Introduction to Psychoanalysis is a set of lectures given by Sigmund Freud 1915-17, which became the most popular and widely translated of his works. The 28 lectures offered an elementary stock-taking of his views of the unconscious, dreams, and the theory of neuroses at the time of writing, as well as offering some new technical material to the more advanced reader. In these three-part Introductory Lectures, by beginning with a discussion of Freudian slips in the first part, moving on to dreams in the second, and only tackling the neuroses in the third, Freud succeeded in presenting his ideas as firmly grounded in the common-sense world of everyday experience. Freud built his complete method of psycho-analysis around his dream theories. In the book Dream Psychology: Psychoanalysis for Beginners Freud explains the buried meanings inside dreams, particularly the drive and the connection between the unconscious and conscious, blocked sexual cravings, and the significance of dreams to our overall well-being. Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) was an Austrian neurologist and the father of psychoanalysis, a clinical method for treating psychopathology through dialogue between a patient and a psychoanalyst. In creating psychoanalysis, Freud developed therapeutic techniques such as the use of free association and discovered transference, establishing its central role in the analytic process. Freud\\'s redefinition of sexuality to include its infantile forms led him to formulate the Oedipus complex as the central tenet of psychoanalytical theory. His analysis of dreams as wish-fulfillments provided him with models for the clinical analysis of symptom formation and the mechanisms of repression as well as for elaboration of his theory of the unconscious.\",e-artnow,160,none,9.79E+12,English,\"Feb 8, 2016\"\\r\\n801,Attack on Titan: Volume 13,Hajime Isayama,4.6,428,43.28,SAR,\"NO SAFE PLACE LEFT At great cost to the Garrison and the Survey Corps, Commander Erwin has managed to recover Eren from the Titans who tried to carry him off.

I tell wee stories. And some of them don\\'t even have punchlines. But you\\'ll get used to it as the night goes on, and on, and on, and on and on...\\'In December 2018, after fifty years of belly-laughs, energy and outrage, Billy Connolly announced his retirement from live stand-up comedy. It had been an extraordinary career.When he first started out in the late sixties, Billy played the banjo in the folk clubs of Scotland. Between songs, he would improvise a bit, telling anecdotes from the Clyde shipyard where he\\'d worked. In the process, he made all kinds of discoveries about what audiences found funny, from his own brilliant mimes to the power of speaking irreverently about politics or explicitly about sex. He began to understand the craft of great storytelling. Soon the songs became shorter and the monologues longer, and Billy quickly became recognised as one of the most exciting comedians of his generation.Billy\\'s routines always felt spontaneous. He never wrote scripts, always creating his comedy freshly on stage in the presence of a live audience. A brilliant comic story might be subsequently discarded, adapted or embellished. A quick observation or short anecdote one night, could become a twenty-minute segment by the next night of a tour.Billy always brought a beautiful sense of the absurd to his shows as he riffed on his family, hecklers, swimming in the North Sea or naked bungee jumping. But his comedy can be laced with anger too. He hates pretentiousness and calls out hypocrisy wherever he sees it. His insights about the human condition have shocked many people, while his unique talent and startling appearance on stage gave him license to say anything he damn well pleased about sex, politics or religion. Billy got away with it because he has always had the popular touch. His comedy spans generations and different social tribes in a way that few others have ever managed.Tall Tales and Wee Stories brings together the very best of Billy\\'s storytelling for the first time and includes his most famous routines including, The Last Supper, Jojoba Shampoo, Incontinence Pants and Shouting at Wildebeest. With an introduction and original illustrations by Billy throughout, it is an inspirational, energetic and riotously funny read, and a fitting celebration of our greatest ever comedian.\",Hachette UK,336,\"Humor , Topic , Celebrity &amp, Popular Culture\",9.78E+12,English,\"Oct 17, 2019\"\\r\\n828,\"Mini Habits: Smaller Habits, Bigger Results\",Stephen Guise,4.6,66,23.59,SAR,\"Discover the Life-Changing Strategy of This Worldwide Bestseller in 17 Languages!\\nUPDATED: Includes the best habit tracking apps of 2017.Lasting Change For Early Quitters, Burnouts, The Unmotivated, And Everyone Else Too\\xc2\\xa0\\n\\nWhen I decided to start exercising consistently 10 years ago, this is what actually happened:\\xc2\\xa0I tried \"\"getting motivated.\"\" It worked sometimes.I tried setting audacious big goals. I almost always failed them.I tried to make changes last. They didn\\'t.Like most people who try to change and fail, I assumed that I was the problem.\\n\\nThen one afternoon--after another failed attempt to get motivated to exercise--I (accidentally) started my first mini habit. I initially committed to do one push-up, and it turned into a full workout. I was shocked. This \"\"stupid idea\"\" wasn\\'t supposed to work. I was shocked again when my success with this strategy continued for months (and to this day).\\n\\nI had to consider that maybe I wasn\\'t the problem in those 10 years of mediocre results. Maybe it was my prior strategies that were ineffective, despite being oft-repeated as \"\"the way to change\"\" in countless books and blogs.\\n\\nMy suspicions were correct.\\n\\nIs There A Scientific Explanation For This?\\nAs I sought understanding, I found a plethora of scientific studies that had answers, with nobody to interpret them correctly. Based on the science--which you\\'ll find peppered throughout Mini Habits--we\\'ve been doing it all wrong.\\n\\nYou can succeed without the guilt, intimidation, and repeated failure associated with such strategies as \"\"getting motivated,\"\" New Year\\'s Resolutions, or even \"\"just doing it.\"\" In fact, you need to stop using those strategies if they aren\\'t giving you great results.\\n\\nMost popular strategies don\\'t work well because they require you to fight against your subconscious brain (a fight not easily won). It\\'s only when you start playing by your brain\\'s rules and taking your human limitations seriously--as mini habits show you how to do--that you can achieve lasting change.\\n\\nWhat\\'s A Mini Habit?\\nA mini habit is a very small positive behavior that you force yourself to do every day; its \"\"too small to fail\"\" nature makes it weightless, deceptively powerful, and a superior habit-building strategy. You will have no choice but to believe in yourself when you\\'re always moving forward.\\n\\nThe barrier to the first step is so low that even depressed or \"\"stuck\"\" people can find early success and begin to reverse their lives right away. And if you think one push-up a day is too small to matter, I\\'ve got one heck of a story for you!\\n\\nAim For The First Step\\nThey say when you aim for the moon, you\\'ll land among the stars. Well, that doesn\\'t make sense, as the moon is closer than the stars. I digress.\\xc2\\xa0\\n\\nThe message is that you should aim very high and even if you fall short, you\\'ll still get somewhere. I\\'ve found the opposite to be true in regards to productivity and healthy behaviors. When you aim for the moon, you won\\'t do anything because it\\'s too far away. But when you aim for the step in front of you, you might keep going and reach the moon.\\n\\nI\\'ve used the Mini Habits strategy to get into the best shape of my life, read 10x more books, and write 4x as many words. It started from requiring one push-up from myself every day. How ridiculous is that? Not so ridiculous when you consider the science of the brain, habits, and willpower.\\n\\nThe Mini Habits system works because it\\'s how our brains are designed to change.\\n\\nNote:\\xc2\\xa0This book isn\\'t for eliminating bad habits (some principles could be useful for breaking habits). Mini Habits is a strategy to create permanent healthy habits in: exercise, writing, reading, thinking positively, meditating, drinking water, eating healthy foods, etc.\\n\\nLasting change won\\'t happen until you take that first step into a strategy that works.

Introduction to Psychoanalysis is a set of lectures given by Sigmund Freud 1915-17, which became the most popular and widely translated of his works. The 28 lectures offered an elementary stock-taking of his views of the unconscious, dreams, and the theory of neuroses at the time of writing, as well as offering some new technical material to the more advanced reader. In these three-part Introductory Lectures, by beginning with a discussion of Freudian slips in the first part, moving on to dreams in the second, and only tackling the neuroses in the third, Freud succeeded in presenting his ideas as firmly grounded in the common-sense world of everyday experience. Freud built his complete method of psycho-analysis around his dream theories. In the book Dream Psychology: Psychoanalysis for Beginners Freud explains the buried meanings inside dreams, particularly the drive and the connection between the unconscious and conscious, blocked sexual cravings, and the significance of dreams to our overall well-being. Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) was an Austrian neurologist and the father of psychoanalysis, a clinical method for treating psychopathology through dialogue between a patient and a psychoanalyst. In creating psychoanalysis, Freud developed therapeutic techniques such as the use of free association and discovered transference, establishing its central role in the analytic process. Freud\\'s redefinition of sexuality to include its infantile forms led him to formulate the Oedipus complex as the central tenet of psychoanalytical theory. His analysis of dreams as wish-fulfillments provided him with models for the clinical analysis of symptom formation and the mechanisms of repression as well as for elaboration of his theory of the unconscious.\",e-artnow,160,none,9.79E+12,English,\"Feb 8, 2016\"\\r\\n839,It,Stephen King,4.5,\"4,260\",19.65,SAR,\"It: Chapter Two\\xe2\\x80\\x94now a major motion picture!\\n \\n Stephen King\\xe2\\x80\\x99s terrifying, classic #1 New York Times bestseller, \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca landmark in American literature\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Chicago Sun-Times)\\xe2\\x80\\x94about seven adults who return to their hometown to confront a nightmare they had first stumbled on as teenagers\\xe2\\x80\\xa6an evil without a name: It.\\n\\nWelcome to Derry, Maine.

While business administration professionals tend to consider information technology as a subordinate aspect in business process management for experts to handle, by contrast computer science professionals often consider business goals and organizational regulations as terms that do not deserve much thought but require the appropriate level of abstraction.Matthias Weske argues that all communities involved need to have a common understanding of the different aspects of business process management. To this end, he details the complete business process lifecycle from the modeling phase to process enactment and improvement, taking into account all different stakeholders involved. After starting with a presentation of general foundations and abstraction models, he explains concepts like process orchestrations and choreographies, as well as process properties and data dependencies. Finally, he presents both traditional and advanced business process management architectures, covering, for example, workflow management systems, service-oriented architectures, and data-driven approaches. In addition, he shows how standards like WfMC, SOAP, WSDL, and BPEL fit into the picture.This textbook is ideally suited for classes on business process management, information systems architecture, and workflow management.

Introduction to Psychoanalysis is a set of lectures given by Sigmund Freud 1915-17, which became the most popular and widely translated of his works. The 28 lectures offered an elementary stock-taking of his views of the unconscious, dreams, and the theory of neuroses at the time of writing, as well as offering some new technical material to the more advanced reader. In these three-part Introductory Lectures, by beginning with a discussion of Freudian slips in the first part, moving on to dreams in the second, and only tackling the neuroses in the third, Freud succeeded in presenting his ideas as firmly grounded in the common-sense world of everyday experience. Freud built his complete method of psycho-analysis around his dream theories. In the book Dream Psychology: Psychoanalysis for Beginners Freud explains the buried meanings inside dreams, particularly the drive and the connection between the unconscious and conscious, blocked sexual cravings, and the significance of dreams to our overall well-being. Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) was an Austrian neurologist and the father of psychoanalysis, a clinical method for treating psychopathology through dialogue between a patient and a psychoanalyst. In creating psychoanalysis, Freud developed therapeutic techniques such as the use of free association and discovered transference, establishing its central role in the analytic process. Freud\\'s redefinition of sexuality to include its infantile forms led him to formulate the Oedipus complex as the central tenet of psychoanalytical theory. His analysis of dreams as wish-fulfillments provided him with models for the clinical analysis of symptom formation and the mechanisms of repression as well as for elaboration of his theory of the unconscious.\",e-artnow,160,none,9.79E+12,English,\"Feb 8, 2016\"\\r\\n889,You Are a Badass: How to Stop Doubting Your Greatness and Start Living an Awesome Life,Jen Sincero,4.1,\"1,345\",51.16,SAR,\"YOU ARE A BADASS IS THE SELF-HELP BOOK FOR PEOPLE WHO DESPERATELY WANT TO IMPROVE THEIR LIVES BUT DON\\'T WANT TO GET BUSTED DOING IT.\\n\\nIn this refreshingly entertaining how-to guide, bestselling author and world-traveling success coach, Jen Sincero, serves up 27 bitesized chapters full of hilariously inspiring stories, sage advice, easy exercises, and the occasional swear word, helping you to: - Identify and change the self-sabotaging beliefs and behaviours that stop you from getting what you want.\\n- Create a life you totally love.

I tell wee stories. And some of them don\\'t even have punchlines. But you\\'ll get used to it as the night goes on, and on, and on, and on and on...\\'In December 2018, after fifty years of belly-laughs, energy and outrage, Billy Connolly announced his retirement from live stand-up comedy. It had been an extraordinary career.When he first started out in the late sixties, Billy played the banjo in the folk clubs of Scotland. Between songs, he would improvise a bit, telling anecdotes from the Clyde shipyard where he\\'d worked. In the process, he made all kinds of discoveries about what audiences found funny, from his own brilliant mimes to the power of speaking irreverently about politics or explicitly about sex. He began to understand the craft of great storytelling. Soon the songs became shorter and the monologues longer, and Billy quickly became recognised as one of the most exciting comedians of his generation.Billy\\'s routines always felt spontaneous. He never wrote scripts, always creating his comedy freshly on stage in the presence of a live audience. A brilliant comic story might be subsequently discarded, adapted or embellished. A quick observation or short anecdote one night, could become a twenty-minute segment by the next night of a tour.Billy always brought a beautiful sense of the absurd to his shows as he riffed on his family, hecklers, swimming in the North Sea or naked bungee jumping. But his comedy can be laced with anger too. He hates pretentiousness and calls out hypocrisy wherever he sees it. His insights about the human condition have shocked many people, while his unique talent and startling appearance on stage gave him license to say anything he damn well pleased about sex, politics or religion. Billy got away with it because he has always had the popular touch. His comedy spans generations and different social tribes in a way that few others have ever managed.Tall Tales and Wee Stories brings together the very best of Billy\\'s storytelling for the first time and includes his most famous routines including, The Last Supper, Jojoba Shampoo, Incontinence Pants and Shouting at Wildebeest. With an introduction and original illustrations by Billy throughout, it is an inspirational, energetic and riotously funny read, and a fitting celebration of our greatest ever comedian.\",Hachette UK,336,\"Performing Arts , Television , Genres , Comedy\",9.78E+12,English,\"Oct 17, 2019\"\\r\\n950,Strawberry Shortcake Murder,Joanne Fluke,4,80,43.36,SAR,\"In her debut mystery, Chocolate Chip Cookie Murder, intrepid amateur sleuth and bakery owner Hannah Swensen proved that when it comes to crime, nothing is sweeter than a woman who knows how to really mix it up.

While business administration professionals tend to consider information technology as a subordinate aspect in business process management for experts to handle, by contrast computer science professionals often consider business goals and organizational regulations as terms that do not deserve much thought but require the appropriate level of abstraction.Matthias Weske argues that all communities involved need to have a common understanding of the different aspects of business process management. To this end, he details the complete business process lifecycle from the modeling phase to process enactment and improvement, taking into account all different stakeholders involved. After starting with a presentation of general foundations and abstraction models, he explains concepts like process orchestrations and choreographies, as well as process properties and data dependencies. Finally, he presents both traditional and advanced business process management architectures, covering, for example, workflow management systems, service-oriented architectures, and data-driven approaches. In addition, he shows how standards like WfMC, SOAP, WSDL, and BPEL fit into the picture.This textbook is ideally suited for classes on business process management, information systems architecture, and workflow management. This 2nd edition contains major updates on BPMN Version 2 process orchestration and process choreographies, and the chapter on BPM methodologies has been completely rewritten.

But what about the company that is not born with great DNA? How can good companies, mediocre companies, even bad companies achieve enduring greatness? The Study \\nFor years, this question preyed on the mind of Jim Collins. Are there companies that defy gravity and convert long-term mediocrity or worse into long-term superiority? And if so, what are the universal distinguishing characteristics that cause a company to go from good to great? The Standards \\nUsing tough benchmarks, Collins and his research team identified a set of elite companies that made the leap to great results and sustained those results for at least fifteen years. How great? After the leap, the good-to-great companies generated cumulative stock returns that beat the general stock market by an average of seven times in fifteen years, better than twice the results delivered by a composite index of the world\\'s greatest companies, including Coca-Cola, Intel, General Electric, and Merck.The Comparisons \\nThe research team contrasted the good-to-great companies with a carefully selected set of comparison companies that failed to make the leap from good to great. What was different? Why did one set of companies become truly great performers while the other set remained only good? Over five years, the team analyzed the histories of all twenty-eight companies in the study. After sifting through mountains of data and thousands of pages of interviews, Collins and his crew discovered the key determinants of greatness -- why some companies make the leap and others don\\'t. The Findings\\n The findings of the Good to Great study will surprise many readers and shed light on virtually every area of management strategy and practice. The findings include:Level 5 Leaders: The research team was shocked to discover the type of leadership required to achieve greatness. The Hedgehog Concept (Simplicity within the Three Circles): To go from good to great requires transcending the curse of competence. A Culture of Discipline: When you combine a culture of discipline with an ethic of entrepreneurship, you get the magical alchemy of great results. Technology Accelerators: Good-to-great companies think differently about the role of technology. The Flywheel and the Doom Loop: Those who launch radical change programs and wrenching restructurings will almost certainly fail to make the leap.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSome of the key concepts discerned in the study,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d comments Jim Collins, \"\"fly in the face of our modern business culture and will, quite frankly, upset some people.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Perhaps, but who can afford to ignore these findings?\",Harper Collins,320,\"Business &amp, Economics , Development , Business Development\",9.78E+12,English,\"Jul 19, 2011\"\\r\\n1030,Find Me: A Novel,Andr\\xc3\\xa9 Aciman,4.7,38,46.88,SAR,\"A New York Times Bestseller\\n\\nIn this spellbinding exploration of the varieties of love, the author of the worldwide bestseller Call Me by Your Name revisits its complex and beguiling characters decades after their first meeting.

He was accused of killing Keith Russo, a lawyer in a small Florida town. But there were no reliable witnesses and little motive. Just the fact that Russo had botched Quincy\\'s divorce case, that Quincy was black in a largely all-white town and that a blood-splattered torch was found in the boot of Quincy\\'s car. A torch he swore was planted. A torch that was conveniently destroyed in a fire just before his trial. The lack of evidence made no difference to judge or jury. In the eyes of the law Quincy was guilty and, no matter how often he protested his innocence, his punishment was life in prison. Finally, after 22 years, comes Quincy\\'s one and only chance of freedom. An innocence lawyer and minister, Cullen Post, takes on his case. Post has exonerated eight men in the last ten years. He intends to make Quincy the next. But there were powerful and ruthless people behind Russo\\'s murder. They prefer that an innocent man dies in jail rather than one of them. There\\'s one way to guarantee that. They killed one lawyer 22 years ago, and they\\'ll kill another without a second thought.\\n\\nPraise for John Grisham\\'s THE GUARDIANS:...Grisham at his passionate best, conveying every ounce of his anger at the corruption behind the law. It is his finest book for some time. Do not miss it - Daily MailA canny and engrossing blend of two types of Grisham novel: enough of the familiar formula of a single lawsuit in a single town, mixed with a more picaresque and multistranded approach that has the significant advantage of taking in a wider swathe of America - The Sunday TimesDelivered with all his signature easy, flowing style. A past master at the art of deft characterisation and the skilful delivery of hair-raising crescendos, Grisham makes this a deceptively easy read. But The Guardians is much more than a simple legal divertissement... Grisham aims a spotlight at the all-too-prevalent venality of the American \\'win at all costs\\' prosecutorial attitude... much of his inspiration is based on tragic fact - Irish IndependentThe master of the legal thriller turns to one of his real-life passions - freeing those wrongly convicted. Inspired by true stories, the skilful plot follows an \"\"innocence lawyer\"\", who goes up against dangerous foes as he dedicates himself to freeing a man behind bars for the murder of a lawyer - Sunday MirrorThis is typical Grisham: speedy, gripping, very good at conveying the complexities of the law in a digestible way - Sunday ExpressSpeedy and gripping - Daily MirrorNo one with any interest in justice could resist this story, which Grisham has structured with all his familiar skill.

I almost always failed them.I tried to make changes last. They didn\\'t.Like most people who try to change and fail, I assumed that I was the problem.\\n\\nThen one afternoon--after another failed attempt to get motivated to exercise--I (accidentally) started my first mini habit. I initially committed to do one push-up, and it turned into a full workout. I was shocked. This \"\"stupid idea\"\" wasn\\'t supposed to work. I was shocked again when my success with this strategy continued for months (and to this day).\\n\\nI had to consider that maybe I wasn\\'t the problem in those 10 years of mediocre results. Maybe it was my prior strategies that were ineffective, despite being oft-repeated as \"\"the way to change\"\" in countless books and blogs.\\n\\nMy suspicions were correct.\\n\\nIs There A Scientific Explanation For This?\\nAs I sought understanding, I found a plethora of scientific studies that had answers, with nobody to interpret them correctly. Based on the science--which you\\'ll find peppered throughout Mini Habits--we\\'ve been doing it all wrong.\\n\\nYou can succeed without the guilt, intimidation, and repeated failure associated with such strategies as \"\"getting motivated,\"\" New Year\\'s Resolutions, or even \"\"just doing it.\"\" In fact, you need to stop using those strategies if they aren\\'t giving you great results.\\n\\nMost popular strategies don\\'t work well because they require you to fight against your subconscious brain (a fight not easily won). It\\'s only when you start playing by your brain\\'s rules and taking your human limitations seriously--as mini habits show you how to do--that you can achieve lasting change.\\n\\nWhat\\'s A Mini Habit?\\nA mini habit is a very small positive behavior that you force yourself to do every day; its \"\"too small to fail\"\" nature makes it weightless, deceptively powerful, and a superior habit-building strategy. You will have no choice but to believe in yourself when you\\'re always moving forward.\\n\\nThe barrier to the first step is so low that even depressed or \"\"stuck\"\" people can find early success and begin to reverse their lives right away. And if you think one push-up a day is too small to matter, I\\'ve got one heck of a story for you!\\n\\nAim For The First Step\\nThey say when you aim for the moon, you\\'ll land among the stars. Well, that doesn\\'t make sense, as the moon is closer than the stars. I digress.\\xc2\\xa0\\n\\nThe message is that you should aim very high and even if you fall short, you\\'ll still get somewhere. I\\'ve found the opposite to be true in regards to productivity and healthy behaviors. When you aim for the moon, you won\\'t do anything because it\\'s too far away. But when you aim for the step in front of you, you might keep going and reach the moon.\\n\\nI\\'ve used the Mini Habits strategy to get into the best shape of my life, read 10x more books, and write 4x as many words. It started from requiring one push-up from myself every day. How ridiculous is that? Not so ridiculous when you consider the science of the brain, habits, and willpower.\\n\\nThe Mini Habits system works because it\\'s how our brains are designed to change.\\n\\nNote:\\xc2\\xa0This book isn\\'t for eliminating bad habits (some principles could be useful for breaking habits). Mini Habits is a strategy to create permanent healthy habits in: exercise, writing, reading, thinking positively, meditating, drinking water, eating healthy foods, etc.\\n\\nLasting change won\\'t happen until you take that first step into a strategy that works.

While business administration professionals tend to consider information technology as a subordinate aspect in business process management for experts to handle, by contrast computer science professionals often consider business goals and organizational regulations as terms that do not deserve much thought but require the appropriate level of abstraction.Matthias Weske argues that all communities involved need to have a common understanding of the different aspects of business process management. To this end, he details the complete business process lifecycle from the modeling phase to process enactment and improvement, taking into account all different stakeholders involved. After starting with a presentation of general foundations and abstraction models, he explains concepts like process orchestrations and choreographies, as well as process properties and data dependencies. Finally, he presents both traditional and advanced business process management architectures, covering, for example, workflow management systems, service-oriented architectures, and data-driven approaches.

Finally, after 22 years, comes Quincy\\'s one and only chance of freedom. An innocence lawyer and minister, Cullen Post, takes on his case. Post has exonerated eight men in the last ten years. He intends to make Quincy the next. But there were powerful and ruthless people behind Russo\\'s murder. They prefer that an innocent man dies in jail rather than one of them. There\\'s one way to guarantee that. They killed one lawyer 22 years ago, and they\\'ll kill another without a second thought.\\n\\nPraise for John Grisham\\'s THE GUARDIANS:...Grisham at his passionate best, conveying every ounce of his anger at the corruption behind the law. It is his finest book for some time. Do not miss it - Daily MailA canny and engrossing blend of two types of Grisham novel: enough of the familiar formula of a single lawsuit in a single town, mixed with a more picaresque and multistranded approach that has the significant advantage of taking in a wider swathe of America - The Sunday TimesDelivered with all his signature easy, flowing style. A past master at the art of deft characterisation and the skilful delivery of hair-raising crescendos, Grisham makes this a deceptively easy read. But The Guardians is much more than a simple legal divertissement... Grisham aims a spotlight at the all-too-prevalent venality of the American \\'win at all costs\\' prosecutorial attitude... much of his inspiration is based on tragic fact - Irish IndependentThe master of the legal thriller turns to one of his real-life passions - freeing those wrongly convicted. Inspired by true stories, the skilful plot follows an \"\"innocence lawyer\"\", who goes up against dangerous foes as he dedicates himself to freeing a man behind bars for the murder of a lawyer - Sunday MirrorThis is typical Grisham: speedy, gripping, very good at conveying the complexities of the law in a digestible way - Sunday ExpressSpeedy and gripping - Daily MirrorNo one with any interest in justice could resist this story, which Grisham has structured with all his familiar skill. The good characters are sympathetic, the wicked are truly revolting and the rage is wholly understandable - Literary Review************\\n\\nTHE INNOCENT MAN by John Grisham is now a major six-part documentary series on Netflix************\",Hachette UK,384,none,9.78E+12,English,\"Oct 15, 2019\"\\r\\n1117,Becoming Steve Jobs: The Evolution of a Reckless Upstart into a Visionary Leader,Brent Schlender,4.6,36,70.88,SAR,\"The #1 New York Times bestselling biography of how Steve Jobs became the most visionary CEO in history.\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\n\\n Becoming Steve Jobs\\xc2\\xa0breaks down the conventional, one-dimensional view of Steve Jobs that he was half-genius, half-jerk from youth, an irascible and selfish leader who slighted friends and family alike. Becoming Steve Jobs answers the central question about the life and career of the Apple cofounder and CEO: How did a young man so reckless and arrogant that he was exiled from the company he founded become the most effective visionary business leader of our time, ultimately transforming the daily life of billions of people?\\n\\n Drawing on incredible and sometimes exclusive access, Schlender and Tetzeli tell a different story of a real human being who wrestled with his failings and learned to maximize his strengths over time. Their rich, compelling narrative is filled with stories never told before from the people who knew Jobs best, including his family, former inner circle executives, and top people at Apple, Pixar and Disney, most notably Tim Cook, Jony Ive, Eddy Cue, Ed Catmull, John Lasseter, Robert Iger and many others. In addition, Schlender knew Jobs personally for 25 years and draws upon his many interviews with him, on and off the record, in writing the book. He and Tetzeli humanize the man and explain, rather than simply describe, his behavior. Along the way, the book provides rich context about the technology revolution we\\'ve all lived through, and the ways in which Jobs changed our world.\\n\\n A rich and revealing account, Becoming Steve Jobs shows us how one of the most colorful and compelling figures of our times was able to combine his unchanging, relentless passion with an evolution in management style to create one of the most valuable and beloved companies on the planet.\",Crown Business,464,\"Biography &amp, Autobiography , Business\",9.78E+12,English,\"Mar 24, 2015\"\\r\\n1118,Antiques Chop,Barbara Allan,4.5,4,29.9,SAR,\"\"\"One of the funniest cozy series going.\"\" --Ellery Queen Mystery Magazine\\n\\nBrandy Borne and her dramatically ditzy mother, Vivian, are stars of the new reality show, Antiques Sleuths.

The Art of War By Sun Tzu translated and commented on by Lionel Giles, On War by Carl von Clausewitz, The Art of War by Niccol\\xc3\\xb2 Machiavelli, and The Art of War by Baron De Jomini. These four books will give you as complete a view on the art of war as you can attain. This is the most important book ever written about warfare and conflict. Lionel Giles\\' translation is the definitive edition and his commentary is indispensable. The Art of War can be used and adapted in every facet of your life. This book explains when and how to go to war, as well as when not to. Learn how to win any conflict whether it be on the battlefield or in the boardroom. Although Carl von Clausewitz participated in many military campaigns, he was primarily a military theorist interested in the examination of war. On War is the West\\'s premier work on the philosophy of war. Other soldiers before him had written treatises on various military subjects, but none undertook a great philosophical examination of war on the scale of Clausewitz\\'s. On War is considered to be the first modern book of military strategy. This is due mainly to Clausewitz\\' integration of political, social, and economic issues as some of the most important factors in deciding the outcomes of a war. It is one of the most important treatises on strategy ever written, and continues to be required reading at many military academies. Niccolo Machiavelli considered this book his greatest achievement. Here you will learn how to recruit, train, motivate, and discipline an army. You will learn the difference between strategy and tactics. Machiavelli does a masterful job of breaking down and analyzing historic battles. This book of military knowledge belongs alongside Sun-Tzu and Clausewitz on every book shelf. Antoine-Henri Jomini was the most celebrated writer on the Napoleonic art of war. Jomini was present at most of the most important battles of the Napoleonic Wars. His writing, therefore, is the most authoritative on the subject. \"\"The art of war, as generally considered, consists of five purely military branches,-viz.: Strategy, Grand Tactics, Logistics, Engineering, and Tactics. A sixth and essential branch, hitherto unrecognized, might be termed Diplomacy in its relation to War. Although this branch is more naturally and intimately connected with the profession of a statesman than with that of a soldier, it cannot be denied that, if it be useless to a subordinate general, it is indispensable to every general commanding an army.\"\" -Antoine-Henri Jomini\",Simon and Schuster,667,none,9.78E+12,English,\"Apr 29, 2013\"\\r\\n1172,Critical Role Vox Machina: Origins: Volume 1,Matthew Mercer,5,15,66.9,SAR,\"From the creators of the hit show \"\"Critical Role\"\" comes Vox Machina\\'s origin story!

The time has come for her to learn about who she is, who her mother is, and to train and develop her special powers. Her father, Duncan, must lead his men south, to the great water city of Esephus, to attempt to free his fellow countrymen from the iron grip of Pandesia. Alec escapes with Marco from The Flames to find himself on the run through the Wood of Thorns, chased by exotic beasts. Merk, despite his better judgment, turns back to help the girl, and finds himself, for the first time in his life, entangled in a stranger\\xe2\\x80\\x99s affairs. Vesuvius spurs his giant as he leads the Trolls on their mission underground, attempting to bypass The Flames, while the dragon, Theos, has his own special mission on Escalon. In THE WEIGHT OF HONOR, Kyra finally meets her cryptic uncle, and is shocked to discover he is not the man she expected. She embarks on a period of training which will test her stamina and her frustration, as she soon encounters the limits of her power. Duncan must descend the peaks of Kos with his new army and, vastly outnumbered, launch a risky invasion on the capital. If he wins, waiting behind its ancient walls, he knows, will be the old king and his nest of nobles and aristocrats, all with their own agendas, all of them as quick to betray as they are to embrace. Alec, in Ur, must tap his unique skills in the forge to aid the resistance if they have any chance of defending against the looming Pandesian invasion. Merk finally enters the tower of Ur, and is stunned by what he discovers. Vesuvius leads his Troll nation across a vulnerable Escalon, devastating the land, while Theos, enraged at what becomes of his son, is on a rampage himself, and will not stop until all of Escalon is aflame. With its strong atmosphere and complex characters, KINGS AND SORCERERS is a sweeping saga of knights and warriors, of kings and lords, of honor and valor, of magic, destiny, monsters and dragons.

If an item is \"\"free\"\" it must be a bargain, right? Why is everything relative, even when it shouldn\\'t be? How do our expectations influence our actual opinions and decisions? In this astounding book, behavioural economist Dan Ariely cuts to the heart of our strange behaviour, demonstrating how irrationality often supplants rational thought and that the reason for this is embedded in the very structure of our minds. Predicatably Irrational brilliantly blends everyday experiences with a series of illuminating and often surprising experiments, that will change your understanding of human behaviour. And, by recognising these patterns, Ariely shows that we can make better decisions in business, in matters of collective welfare, and in our everyday lives from drinking coffee to losing weight, buying a car to choosing a romantic partner.\",HarperCollins UK,304,none,9.78E+12,English,\"Mar 6, 2009\"\\r\\n1196,Mrs. Pollifax Unveiled,Dorothy Gilman,3.9,21,31.46,SAR,\"After facing down hijackers on a flight to the Middle East and saving the lives of the passengers on board, a young American woman steps off the plane in Damascus in a blaze of celebrity and disappears.

The Art of War By Sun Tzu translated and commented on by Lionel Giles, On War by Carl von Clausewitz, The Art of War by Niccol\\xc3\\xb2 Machiavelli, and The Art of War by Baron De Jomini. These four books will give you as complete a view on the art of war as you can attain. This is the most important book ever written about warfare and conflict. Lionel Giles\\' translation is the definitive edition and his commentary is indispensable. The Art of War can be used and adapted in every facet of your life. This book explains when and how to go to war, as well as when not to. Learn how to win any conflict whether it be on the battlefield or in the boardroom. Although Carl von Clausewitz participated in many military campaigns, he was primarily a military theorist interested in the examination of war. On War is the West\\'s premier work on the philosophy of war. Other soldiers before him had written treatises on various military subjects, but none undertook a great philosophical examination of war on the scale of Clausewitz\\'s. On War is considered to be the first modern book of military strategy. This is due mainly to Clausewitz\\' integration of political, social, and economic issues as some of the most important factors in deciding the outcomes of a war. It is one of the most important treatises on strategy ever written, and continues to be required reading at many military academies. Niccolo Machiavelli considered this book his greatest achievement. Here you will learn how to recruit, train, motivate, and discipline an army. You will learn the difference between strategy and tactics. Machiavelli does a masterful job of breaking down and analyzing historic battles. This book of military knowledge belongs alongside Sun-Tzu and Clausewitz on every book shelf. Antoine-Henri Jomini was the most celebrated writer on the Napoleonic art of war. Jomini was present at most of the most important battles of the Napoleonic Wars. His writing, therefore, is the most authoritative on the subject. \"\"The art of war, as generally considered, consists of five purely military branches,-viz.: Strategy, Grand Tactics, Logistics, Engineering, and Tactics. A sixth and essential branch, hitherto unrecognized, might be termed Diplomacy in its relation to War. Although this branch is more naturally and intimately connected with the profession of a statesman than with that of a soldier, it cannot be denied that, if it be useless to a subordinate general, it is indispensable to every general commanding an army.\"\" -Antoine-Henri Jomini\",Simon and Schuster,667,none,9.78E+12,English,\"Apr 29, 2013\"\\r\\n1223,Marketing (The Brian Tracy Success Library),Brian Tracy,,,29.4,SAR,\"Too often, businesses create a product or service and then focus their marketing efforts on trying to convince customers that they need it.

But what about the company that is not born with great DNA? How can good companies, mediocre companies, even bad companies achieve enduring greatness? The Study \\nFor years, this question preyed on the mind of Jim Collins. Are there companies that defy gravity and convert long-term mediocrity or worse into long-term superiority? And if so, what are the universal distinguishing characteristics that cause a company to go from good to great? The Standards \\nUsing tough benchmarks, Collins and his research team identified a set of elite companies that made the leap to great results and sustained those results for at least fifteen years. How great? After the leap, the good-to-great companies generated cumulative stock returns that beat the general stock market by an average of seven times in fifteen years, better than twice the results delivered by a composite index of the world\\'s greatest companies, including Coca-Cola, Intel, General Electric, and Merck.The Comparisons \\nThe research team contrasted the good-to-great companies with a carefully selected set of comparison companies that failed to make the leap from good to great. What was different? Why did one set of companies become truly great performers while the other set remained only good? Over five years, the team analyzed the histories of all twenty-eight companies in the study. After sifting through mountains of data and thousands of pages of interviews, Collins and his crew discovered the key determinants of greatness -- why some companies make the leap and others don\\'t. The Findings\\n The findings of the Good to Great study will surprise many readers and shed light on virtually every area of management strategy and practice. The findings include:Level 5 Leaders: The research team was shocked to discover the type of leadership required to achieve greatness. The Hedgehog Concept (Simplicity within the Three Circles): To go from good to great requires transcending the curse of competence. A Culture of Discipline: When you combine a culture of discipline with an ethic of entrepreneurship, you get the magical alchemy of great results. Technology Accelerators: Good-to-great companies think differently about the role of technology. The Flywheel and the Doom Loop: Those who launch radical change programs and wrenching restructurings will almost certainly fail to make the leap.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSome of the key concepts discerned in the study,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d comments Jim Collins, \"\"fly in the face of our modern business culture and will, quite frankly, upset some people.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Perhaps, but who can afford to ignore these findings?\",Harper Collins,320,\"Business &amp, Economics , Corporate &amp, Business History\",9.78E+12,English,\"Jul 19, 2011\"\\r\\n1225,The Queen of Nothing (The Folk of the Air #3),Holly Black,5,11,36.86,SAR,\"The intoxicating and bloodthirsty finale to the New York Times bestselling The Cruel Prince, nominated for the CILIP CARNEGIE MEDAL 2019, and  New York Times bestseller The Wicked King \\n\\nAfter being pronounced Queen of Faerie and then abruptly exiled by the Wicked King Cardan, Jude finds herself unmoored, the queen of nothing.

While business administration professionals tend to consider information technology as a subordinate aspect in business process management for experts to handle, by contrast computer science professionals often consider business goals and organizational regulations as terms that do not deserve much thought but require the appropriate level of abstraction.Matthias Weske argues that all communities involved need to have a common understanding of the different aspects of business process management. To this end, he details the complete business process lifecycle from the modeling phase to process enactment and improvement, taking into account all different stakeholders involved. After starting with a presentation of general foundations and abstraction models, he explains concepts like process orchestrations and choreographies, as well as process properties and data dependencies. Finally, he presents both traditional and advanced business process management architectures, covering, for example, workflow management systems, service-oriented architectures, and data-driven approaches. In addition, he shows how standards like WfMC, SOAP, WSDL, and BPEL fit into the picture.This textbook is ideally suited for classes on business process management, information systems architecture, and workflow management. This 2nd edition contains major updates on BPMN Version 2 process orchestration and process choreographies, and the chapter on BPM methodologies has been completely rewritten.

While business administration professionals tend to consider information technology as a subordinate aspect in business process management for experts to handle, by contrast computer science professionals often consider business goals and organizational regulations as terms that do not deserve much thought but require the appropriate level of abstraction.Matthias Weske argues that all communities involved need to have a common understanding of the different aspects of business process management. To this end, he details the complete business process lifecycle from the modeling phase to process enactment and improvement, taking into account all different stakeholders involved. After starting with a presentation of general foundations and abstraction models, he explains concepts like process orchestrations and choreographies, as well as process properties and data dependencies. Finally, he presents both traditional and advanced business process management architectures, covering, for example, workflow management systems, service-oriented architectures, and data-driven approaches. In addition, he shows how standards like WfMC, SOAP, WSDL, and BPEL fit into the picture.This textbook is ideally suited for classes on business process management, information systems architecture, and workflow management.

Introduction to Psychoanalysis is a set of lectures given by Sigmund Freud 1915-17, which became the most popular and widely translated of his works. The 28 lectures offered an elementary stock-taking of his views of the unconscious, dreams, and the theory of neuroses at the time of writing, as well as offering some new technical material to the more advanced reader. In these three-part Introductory Lectures, by beginning with a discussion of Freudian slips in the first part, moving on to dreams in the second, and only tackling the neuroses in the third, Freud succeeded in presenting his ideas as firmly grounded in the common-sense world of everyday experience. Freud built his complete method of psycho-analysis around his dream theories. In the book Dream Psychology: Psychoanalysis for Beginners Freud explains the buried meanings inside dreams, particularly the drive and the connection between the unconscious and conscious, blocked sexual cravings, and the significance of dreams to our overall well-being. Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) was an Austrian neurologist and the father of psychoanalysis, a clinical method for treating psychopathology through dialogue between a patient and a psychoanalyst. In creating psychoanalysis, Freud developed therapeutic techniques such as the use of free association and discovered transference, establishing its central role in the analytic process. Freud\\'s redefinition of sexuality to include its infantile forms led him to formulate the Oedipus complex as the central tenet of psychoanalytical theory. His analysis of dreams as wish-fulfillments provided him with models for the clinical analysis of symptom formation and the mechanisms of repression as well as for elaboration of his theory of the unconscious.\",e-artnow,160,\"Psychology , Cognitive Psychology &amp, Cognition\",9.79E+12,English,\"Feb 8, 2016\"\\r\\n1275,Kiss the Girls and Make Them Cry,Mary Higgins Clark,4,1,42.26,SAR,\"AN ELECTRIFYING NEW THRILLER FROM \\'QUEEN OF SUSPENSE\\'\\xc2\\xa0MARY HIGGINS CLARK . . .\\n\\n When investigative journalist Gina Kane receives an email from a \\'CRyan\\'\\xc2\\xa0describing her \\'terrible experience\\'\\xc2\\xa0while working at REL, a high-profile television news network, including the comment \\'and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not the only one,\\'\\xc2\\xa0Gina knows she has to pursue the story.
